# Hexagonal 2048

Deployed - [https://quirky-jones-56375b.netlify.app/](https://quirky-jones-56375b.netlify.app/)

**Run local tests:** <br>

Ps: In order for the control keys to work, the game board must be in focus. By default, the focus is set automatically. But if you move it manually during the game - do not forget to click on the field to continue the game.

Pps: I know it's not perfect. But that's why I want to come to you - to learn and become better. And I will try very hard!
